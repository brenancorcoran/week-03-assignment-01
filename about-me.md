Hi! My name is Brenan Corcoran and I am a 25 year old student at Loyola University in Chicago, IL. I was born and raised in Northern New Jersey, and moved to Chicago when I was 22 years old to play music in a band. I plan to receive my Bachelor's degree from Loyola University in Information Technology by the end of 2022.
